‘The financial impacts of COVID19 on world stock markets – a time series analysis’

In this project, I will be analysis the trends in stock market as a result of COVID-19 outbreak. 

Datasets
For this analysis, I have chosen three forms of sources of data. 

CSV/Excel/PDF or another flat file source:  

The time series covid19 global datasets – confirmed, deaths and recovered. Each of these csv files have daily updated data with respect to country (262 records each). I am planning on merging the datasets to have information of confirmed, deaths and recovered in one file. All three datasets are found here. https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases
